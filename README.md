# CRUD - Laravel 8

There are few breaking changes in `Laravel 8` which don't allow to follow the `Laravel 7 or older`. So, If you are new to Laravel then you might need to know the basic breaking changes because without that you can not make anything.

> Laravel docs is always a central point for knowing the changes. If you would like to see these changes in action then you are at right place.
